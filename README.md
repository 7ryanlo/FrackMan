# FrackMan

PC Console game

Computer game spin-off of popular Namco arcade game "Dig Dug." Play as the FrackMan as he digs through the oil field searching for all the current level's oil barrels. But watchout! Environmentalist protestors and hardcore protestors** seek to undermine FrackMan's quest by making him lose life (by shouting at him to stop). Armed with a water squirter, find the oil barrels hidden in the oil field and get the high score before losing all your lives. 

**Hardcore protestors act exactly like regular protestors except they can also use pathfinding algorithms to follow FrackMan!
